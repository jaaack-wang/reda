REDA: **R**evised **E**asy **D**ata **A**ugmentation, inspired by the [Easy Data Augmentation (EDA) program](https://github.com/jasonwei20/eda_nlp), contains a set of general token-level text augmentation techniques that can be easily applied to other languages with proper revisions. 

The `reda` folder contains the original code for `reda`, and a text augmenter program that utilizes `reda` to augment data for text pair classification tasks. The `data_aug_app` folder shows examples of using these two programs to do text augmentation.
